      <p className="inline-block font-thin text-left items-start justify-start py-5">
        In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values. A variable is
        simply a name that represents a value.{" "}
        <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">
          Before you can use a variable in JavaScript, you must declare it. You
          declare a variable by using the "var" keyword followed by the variable
          name.
        </span>

      <h2 className="text-2xl">Important things to know about variables</h2>
      <ol className="inline-block font-thin text-left items-start justify-start py-1 list-decimal">
        <li className="p-5">
          A variable is a container for storing data values in JavaScript.
        </li>
        <li className="p-5">
          Variables can be declared using the "let", "const", or "var" keywords.
        </li>
        <li className="p-5">
          Variables declared with "let" and "const" are block-scoped, meaning
          they are only accessible within the block of code where they are
          declared.
        </li>
        <li className="p-5">
          Variables declared with "var" are function-scoped, meaning they are
          accessible within the entire function where they are declared.
        </li>
        <li className="p-5">
          The "let" keyword is used to declare variables that can be reassigned
          a new value, while the "const" keyword is used to declare variables
          whose value cannot be reassigned.
        </li>
        <li className="p-5">
          Variables can be initialized with a value at the time of declaration,
          like this:
        </li>
        <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-md my-7">
          <pre>
            <code className="text-sm font-mono">{codeSnippet}</code>
          </pre>
          <button
            onClick={() => navigator.clipboard.writeText(codeSnippet)}
            className="mt-2 bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded"

          </button>
        </div>
        <li className="p-5">
          JavaScript variables can hold different types of data, including
          numbers, strings, Booleans, objects, and arrays.
        </li>
        <li className="p-5">
          Variables that are not initialized at the time of declaration are
          assigned the value "undefined" by default.
        </li>

        <li className="p-5">
          It is best practice to declare variables before using them to avoid
          unintentional global variables, which can cause unexpected behavior in
          your code.
        </li>
        <li className="p-5">
          JavaScript variables are dynamically typed, meaning that their data
          type can change during runtime based on the value they hold.
        </li>
        <li className="p-5">
          Global variables are accessible from anywhere in the code, which can
          make them prone to causing issues like naming conflicts and unintended
          side effects.
        </li>
        <li className="p-5">
          It is recommended to use "const" whenever possible to prevent
          accidental reassignment of variables and to promote code clarity and
          predictability
